# Population-coding-in-an-Innately-Relevant-Olfactory-Area
Iurilli and Datta, 2017 - Neuron     
This repository contains custom Arduino code for olfactometer control, Matlab scripts for behavioral experiments and wrapper code for classification analysis and concentration analysis as performed in Iurilli and Datta, 2017.
Note that the Matlab scripts for classification analysis employ the LIBSVM library that can be downloaded here (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/).
This repository also contains the data used in the paper as .mat files. The prefix of each file indicates the area (aPCx = anterior Piriform Cortex; plCoA = postero-lateral Cortical Amygdala).
